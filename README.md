# Welcome to the Machine Learning Course!
If you're looking at this just before session 2 starts, you need to redownload the machine_learning.ipynb file since there are a couple of updates. 

Before the course starts, please make sure you have installed the necessary software and packages. You can find them in the notebook. Doing this means we can get to the interesting stuff straight away once the sessions begin!

The easiest way of having the necessary packages is to install the most recent version Anaconda. If you're having trouble with installation, come to the session from 6:30pm for help setting up. See you there!
